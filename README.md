## 📌 Overview

The **Third Eye for Blind** is an **Arduino-powered wearable assistive device** that helps visually impaired users by:

- Detecting nearby obstacles
- Guiding users via **vibration feedback**
- Providing **compass-based direction sensing**
- Supporting **emergency alert mode**

## 🔧 Key Features

| 🧠 Module        | 🚀 Description                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛑 **Obstacle Detection** | Detects objects using 3 ultrasonic sensors (Front, Left, Right).               |
| 🧭 **Compass Mode**       | Uses HMC5883L magnetometer to guide direction; triggers alert when facing North. |
| 🚨 **Emergency Mode**     | Sends an emergency signal when a specific condition is triggered.               |
| 📡 **Bluetooth Serial**   | Communication via SoftwareSerial on pins 0 and 1.                              |
| 🎮 **Sensor Switching**   | Modes (Sensor, Compass, Emergency) are switchable via digital input.           |
| 📟 **Feedback System**    | Alerts users through two vibration motors (pins 8 and 9).                      |

## 🧠 Core Logic Summary

### 1️⃣ Sensor Mode
- Measures distances from 3 ultrasonic sensors
- Based on thresholds:
  - Both sides blocked → alert both vibrators
  - Clear path → activate only one motor based on direction
  - Distance threshold: `< 50cm` (customizable)

### 2️⃣ Compass Mode
- Reads magnetometer via I2C
- Converts vector data to compass heading
- Alerts user when facing **North** (0° ± 20°)
- After 3 alerts → returns to Sensor Mode

### 3️⃣ Emergency Mode
- Activated after a long button press
- Sends alert signal
- Waits 10 seconds before returning to Sensor Mode
